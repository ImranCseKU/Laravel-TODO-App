## Laravel TODO Application

TODO means "to do". Something that someone will need to do. To build this application i used Laravel 5.8 where i performed simple CRUD operation. All the features of Laravel that I have used in this application are listed below-

- Blade templete
- Migration & Model
- Eloquent ORM
- Factory and seeder
- Validation
- Flash messaging
- Route Model Binding


to run this application in your browser just run "php artisan serve" command.

> if you are using xampp and wamp or any other software like this then It is advised to use a wrapper when building a url within a blade template. such as url() or route() helper method.

E.g:
href="{{ url('/todos') }}"
